## Project description
<p align="justify">
	A perfect first challenge if you're new to HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal if you haven't learned about building responsive layouts yet.
	Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. <br>
	You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
